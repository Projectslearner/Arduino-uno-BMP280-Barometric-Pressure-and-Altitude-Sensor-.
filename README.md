   - Wire the BMP280 sensor to the Arduino according to the circuit diagram.

2. **Upload the Code:**
   - Copy and paste the provided code into the Arduino IDE.
   - Verify and upload the code to your Arduino board.

3. **Monitor the Serial Output:**
   - Open the Serial Monitor to view temperature, pressure, and altitude data.
   - Ensure that the BMP280 sensor is initialized successfully and data is being read.

### Project Operation

- **Initialization:**
  - The Arduino initializes serial communication and checks if the BMP280 sensor is detected.

- **Sensor Configuration:**
  - The BMP280 sensor is configured with sampling settings for temperature, pressure, and filtering.

- **Data Reading:**
  - The Arduino reads temperature, pressure, and altitude data from the BMP280 sensor.

- **Serial Output:**
  - Temperature, pressure, and altitude data are printed to the Serial Monitor.

### Applications
